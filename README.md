# Tensorflow VGG16 and VGG19

This is a Tensorflow implemention of Deep3D (The original MXNet implementation can be found in the github repository: <a href="https://github.com/piiswrong/deep3d">Deep3D-MXNet</a>. The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.03650">published paper</a> describes the development and performance of this network. 

The backbone of this network is built from the github repository of an <a href="https://github.com/machrisaa/tensorflow-vgg">implementation of VGG19</a>.
